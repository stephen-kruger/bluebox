=Installing=
Download the war file from [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_idaoMmuNnyYW9FS1paTEhuSXc&usp=sharing here].
  * Drop the war file into your favourite application server.
This one requires no special setup, and uses an embedded Derby database. 
  * If you want you can edit bluebox.properties and select the MongoDB driver instead - especially useful for larger mailboxes.
  * You will require Java 7.
  * access to the administration page requires user/password for role "tomcat", so edit your tomcat-users.conf file or whatever your app server uses


=What is it?=
Many teams develop software that rely heavily on sending emails (for sign-up, social software notifications etc).
Properly testing this software requires multiple "fake" email addesses to allow testing of the capabilities of the software from various points of view and roles
Traditionally we either used Google Mail (which allowed random prefixes to be added to email addresses), or other services such as Mailinator
However sending such emails from unreleased products, potentially containing trade secrets, non-public product information and other private information to the public internet is not feasible, and an internal service was needed.

=How do I use it?=
The easiest way : simply send an email to any address you like using the @bluebox.lotus.com domain
For example send a test mail using your Notes client to test@bluebox.lotus.com or fake.mail@bluebox.lotus.com
Then enter the email address into the form here at BlueBox to show your inbox
Another way : set your SMTP server to bluebox.lotus.com, you can send emails to any address and any domain (although they will all be delivered and available only on bluebox.lotus.com)

=How long will my email be available?=
Messages will be automatically deleted after 48 hours
Mails in the Trash folder (i.e. explicitly deleted by the user)will be removed after 12 hours
If you require it for longer, simply use the Download button to save a copy to disk, or attach to a defect report
You can then use the Upload functionality to re-inject it into the system as many times as you like

=SMTP Open Relay Test scans are complaining Bluebox is an open relay=
These scans generally test if an SMTP server accepts email from arbitrary domains.
By design, Bluebox IS very forgiving, and will accept any messages unless otherwise configured via blacklist or whitelist
However no mails, regardless of recipient, are EVER forwarded on to other systems. So any scan which implies Bluebox is an open relay is not correctly implemented, as they would need to validate that a test email is actually delivered to a different MX domain - but generally these tests are lazily written, and only go as far as testing that the SMTP server performs the "accept" handshake.
It is possible to defend against some of these poorly written relay scans by intelligently configuring the bluebox_to_blacklist or bluebox_from_blacklist in bluebox.properties: Run the offending scan program, and check the app server logs to detect what email is being used to run the test (e.g. test@microsoft.com), and then add that domain to the bluebox_to_blacklist, which will cause rejection of any messages from that domain, hopefully fooling the simple-minded Open Relay scan.

=Can I send mails to other domains?=
BlueBox itself does not do any mail forwarding, only incoming mail is accepted
It's not very scrupulous about destination addresses, so if you have set bluebox as your smtp server, you can send to any hostnames that you like. Such as stephen@ibm.com, steve@lotuslive.com, or any other domain you might want

=Terms and conditions of usage=
Please do not use BlueBox for any business critical applications
Please respect others may be using the system - don't delete mails which are not yours
